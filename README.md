# Front-End-Demos-FirstDemo

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

this is going to be a recreation of the google home page using basic html elements and styling.

The project is mostly finished. could not find out how to make to footer stay at the bottom of the page, but over all it looks very close to the actual good homepage.
